        <p>This is a photo of my first flag football game at UMaine</p>

        <p>When I first got to UMaine I wanted to try and get involved in a club to meet new people. So me and a few of my friends created a flag football team. This is a picture of our first game under the lights. We may not have been that good but it was a good time.</p>

        <p>Now that flag football has ended I am doing floor hockey and softball. These are going to be very fun and I am looking forward to playing in them.</p>
