        <p>This is a picture of me and my little cousin at a Hartford Yardgoats baseball game.</p>

        <p>This picture was of my cousin holding a gameball that I had caught and given to him. He was very happy and had a great time.</p>

        <p>A lot of my family also went and we had an overall great time as it was one of my cousins first actual baseball games that he went to.</p>
