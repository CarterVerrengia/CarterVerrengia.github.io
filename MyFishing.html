        <p>This is a picture of me fishing at Black Ledge Country club. I worked here for over a year and me and one of my friends decided to take a few casts while we were golfing on the golf course.</p>

        <p>I spent a lot of my time fishing this summer with my friends. Most of it was freshwater fishing rather than saltwater fishing. It is one of my favorite hobbies to do because it is so unpredictable. You never know if you will catch anything or how big of a fish you will catch. Either way it is always fun to get outside and enjoy the outdoors.</p>
